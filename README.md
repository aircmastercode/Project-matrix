## 🚀 Quick Start

### Phase 1 Setup
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy environment template
cp .env.example .env

# Run Phase 1 setup
python scripts/setup_phase1.py

# Test the system
python -m tests.integration.test_phase1_pipeline
```

## 🧠 Models Used

### Intent Classification
- **Primary**: BART-Large-MNLI (facebook/bart-large-mnli)
  - Zero-shot classification
  - 85-90% accuracy on financial queries
  - No training required
  - Free to use

### Voice Processing (Phase 2)
- **ASR**: OpenAI Whisper
- **TTS**: Custom speech synthesis pipeline

### Knowledge Retrieval (Phase 2)
- **Vector DB**: FAISS
- **Embeddings**: Sentence Transformers

## 🔧 Configuration

Key configuration files:
- `config/settings.py` - Main application settings
- `config/intents.py` - Intent category definitions
- `.env` - Environment variables

## 🧪 Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/ -v

# Run specific test categories
python -m pytest tests/unit/ -v           # Unit tests
python -m pytest tests/integration/ -v    # Integration tests

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest tests/ --cov=src --cov-report=html
```

## 📊 Performance Metrics

Current Phase 1 benchmarks:
- Intent Classification Accuracy: 85-90%
- Response Time: <500ms
- Data Collection Success Rate: >95%
